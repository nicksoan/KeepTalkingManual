# KeepTalkingManual

A (very) rough POC for streamlining the Manual for "Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes".

The idea is to build quick reference app to replace the pdf found at https://www.bombmanual.com/ that will allow players to quickly navigate to the correct section for each of the puzzle modules, rather than needing to look through the PDF. 

Additional idea to be able to input some rough details about the sections in order to more quickly filter through the options and decide the correct course of action.

Does this detract from the intended franticness of having to manually search through the rules? Absolutely. But if you've ever met a software developer, the analysis, categorisation and ordering of facts for a given output is (almost) more fun than playing the actual game.

Also my first attempt at creating an application using the new Blazor framework, and the huge range of complex choices and variables is a good excuse to take it out for a spin.
